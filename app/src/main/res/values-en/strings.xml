    <!-- Datos Opportunity -->
    <string name="opportunity_name">Opportunity</string>
    <string name="opportunity_landing">Meridiani Planum</string>
    <string name="opportunity_date">August 6th, 2012</string>
    <string name="opportunity_title">Surface Exploration</string>
    <string name="opportunity_body">Opportunity was the second of two rover vehicles launched in 2003 to land on Mars and begin traversing
        the Red Planet for signs of past life. The rover is still actively exploring Martian terrain, having more than survived
        to your planned 90-day mission.
        Since landing on Mars in 2004, Opportunity has made a series of discoveries about the Red Planet,
        including dramatic evidence that long ago at least one area of Mars remained wet for an extended period
        and that conditions may have been adequate to support microbial life.
        The Opportunity rover stopped communicating with Earth when a severe dust storm across Mars covered its location in June 2018.
        After more than a thousand commands to reestablish contact, engineers from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Space Flight Operations Facility
        NASA made their last attempt to revive Opportunity on Tuesday, February 13, 2019, but to no avail. The final communication of the solar powered rover
        was received on June 10.</string>

    <string name="curiosity_date">January 5th, 2004</string>
    <string name="curiosity_title">Exploring Gale crater</string>
    <string name="curiosity_body">Curiosity explores Gale crater and acquires rock samples,
         soil and air for analysis on board. The car-sized rover is as tall as a gamer
         basketball and uses a 7 foot long arm to place tools near rocks
         selected for study. Curiosity\'s large size allows you to carry an advanced kit
         of 10 scientific instruments. It has tools including 17 cameras, a laser for
         vaporize and study small rock points from a distance and a drill to collect
         powdered rock samples. Look for special rocks that formed in the water and / or have signs
         organic.</string>
    <!-- Datos Perseverance -->
    <string name="perseverance_name">Perseverance</string>
    <string name="perseverance_landing">Jezero Crater</string>
    <string name="perseverance_date">February 18th, 2021</string>
    <string name="perseverance_title">Technologies for surface operations</string>
    <string name="perseverance_body">Perseverance tests a technology to extract oxygen from the Martian atmosphere,
         which is 96% carbon dioxide. This demo helps mission planners test ways to use
         the natural resources of Mars to support human explorers and improve life support designs,
         transportation and other important systems for living and working on Mars. The rover also monitors the weather
         and dust in the Martian atmosphere. Such studies are important to understand the daily and seasonal changes on Mars,
         and they will help future human explorers better predict Martian weather.</string>
    <!-- Datos Spirit -->
    <string name="spirit_name">Spirit</string>
    <string name="spirit_landing">Sleepy Hollow</string>
    <string name="spirit_date">January 3th, 2004</string>
    <string name="spirit_title">Surface Exploration</string>
    <string name="spirit_body">The Spirit and Opportunity rovers together represented NASA\'s Mars Exploration Rover Mission (MER),
        part of the Mars Exploration Program. Launched a month apart in 2003, the twin rovers\' primary scientific objective was to search
        a variety of rocks and soil types and then look for clues about past water activity on Mars.
        Each rover is about the size of a golf cart and seven times heavier (about 405 pounds or 185 kilograms)
        than the Sojourner rover launched on the Mars Pathfinder to Mars mission in 1996.
        Spirit and Opportunity were sent to opposite sides of Mars to locations suspected of having been affected by liquid water in the past.
        The plan was for the rovers to move from place to place, conduct geological investigations and take pictures with mast-mounted cameras.
        (about 5 feet or 1.5 meters from the ground) that provided 360-degree stereoscopic views of the terrain.</string>
